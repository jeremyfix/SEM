To use the randomFields library

COMPILATION
===========

The folder structure that you shoud create is:

|build
|build_RF
|sem-ecp
    |_randomfield
            |_README_random_fields   <- YOU ARE HERE

Copy the file sem-ecp/randomfield/makefile to the folder build_RF
Make the needed changes (library paths) inside the makefile and compile the library (inside build_RF)


USING INSIDE SEM
================

We suppose that we're running a test case in a folder called TEST. The location of this folder is arbitrary.

Inside TEST you will generate your mesh and then run the properties generation.
This means that you call the executable randomfield.exe from your TEST folder (RF_main_input have the informations
to the random library). This will generate the properties h5 files needed to run the simulation. They will be
located in the TEST/mat/h5 folder. 

Once properties are generated you SEM simulation.


INPUTS
======

Inside input.spec:
-----------------

material {
        type = random;
        random_library_path = "<your ABSOLUTE Path to the folder build_RF>";
};


Inside mat.dat:
--------------
The Domains having the random properties are identified by the leter R.
On the line after the main declaration of random subdomain there should be the statistical parameters.

Example of mat.dat file of 2 random subdomains (1st and 3rd)  and 1 constant subdomain (2nd)

For each "R" subdomain the 4 folowing lines define the statistical and parameterization inputs
In the first line the integer informs the Parameterization Choice - PC (0 for Kappa, 1 for Lambda)
The second, third and forth lines are the statistical inputs for each property. These properties
will be:

If PC = 0
1st. Density
2nd. Kappa
3rd. Mu

If PC = 1 
1st. Density
2nd. Lambda
3rd. Mu 


For each of these properties the statistical inputs are, from left to right
Correlation Model: 1 for gaussian
Correlation Length in X
Correlation Length in Y
Correlation Length in Z
First order marginal (1 for gaussian, 2 for lognormal)
Coefficient of variation
Random seed. If it's smaller than 0 the seed will be determined by the processors clock.

Graphically it means:

1   20.00   20.00  20.00  2  0.25  0 -- Kappa Statistical parameters (If PC = 0, it would be the parameters for Lambda if PC = 1)
1   30.00   40.00  50.00  2  0.0   3 -- Mu Statistical parameters

FAQ
===

-Can I make only one of the properties constant?
Yes, putting 0.0 to the Coefficient of Variation of this parameter.

-What does it mean the Random Seed?
Is the input for the generator of pseudo-random number generator.

-How can I make 2 properties have a 100% correlation?
Putting the same seed AND THE SAME CORRELATION LENGTHS for these properties.

-Why do we have the "Parametrization Choice"?
In most of the cases you want to parameterize your simulation with Kappa and Mu (CP = 0), cause they are independent eigen values
of your behaviour matrix and you are sure that your problem is physically coherent. Sometimes, when thinking in terms of
V_p and V_s, working with Lambda (putting it as a constant) can lead to regimes where there is no mode conversion and this
is specially interesting when you want to validate random media propagation.
