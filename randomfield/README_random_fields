To use the randomFields library

COMPILATION
===========

The folder structure that you shoud create is:

|build
|build_RF
|sem-ecp
    |_randomfield
            |_README_random_fields   <- YOU ARE HERE

Copy the file sem-ecp/randomfield/makefile to the folder build_RF
Make the needed changes (library paths) inside the makefile and compile the library (inside build_RF)


USING INSIDE SEM
================

We suppose that we're running a test case in a folder called TEST. The location of this folder is arbitrary.

Inside TEST you will generate your mesh and then run SEM for the first time. This will continue till the
part where the properties h5 files are needed. At this moment the PROGRAM WILL STOP. It's normal.
The first run generate the inputs needed to the random field library. They will be located in the TEST/mat
folder. Once you've donne that you can generate the random properties by calling the random field library
from this folder. An example file "run.pbs" is created. If you are an IGLOO user using the PBS manager this
file is probably ready for you to execute. Tap qsub run.pbs and the properties will be generated inside the
TEST/mat/h5 folder.

Once properties are generated you re-run SEM and you will be able to complete your simulation.


INPUTS
======

Inside input.spec:
-----------------

material {
        type = random;
        random_library_path = "<your ABSOLUTE Path to the folder build_RF>";
};


Inside mat.dat:
--------------
The Domains having the random properties are identified by the leter R.
On the line after the main declaration of random subdomain there should be the statistical parameters.

Example of mat.dat file of 2 random subdomains (1st and 3rd)  and 1 constant subdomain (2nd)

The statistical inputs are from left to right (line following a R subdomain):
Correlation Model: 1 for gaussian
Correlation Length in X
Correlation Length in Y
Correlation Length in Z
The 6 numbers that follow are the first order marginal (1 for gaussian, 2 for lognormal) and the coeffitient of variation for each property.
The properties are:
1st: Density
2nd: Kappa
3rd: Mu
The last number is the random seed. If it's smaller than 0 the seed will be determined by the processors clock.

Graphically it means:

1   20.00   20.00  20.00   1        0.5    1        1.0   1        2.0  -1
